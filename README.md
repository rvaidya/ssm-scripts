# ssm-scripts
A simple repository of scripts to connect to machines using AWS Systems Manager

All of these scripts are written in bash.

To use the Windows / RDP scripts as-is you need to be running in a bash environment that can execute mstsc.exe - so Ubuntu on WSL or cygwin.
Otherwise, just take the mstsc.exe and cmdkey.exe execution out and connect using your RDP client of choice.
