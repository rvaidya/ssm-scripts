# ssm-scripts
A simple repository of bash scripts to connect to machines using AWS Systems Manager

Prerequisites:

* bash
* aws cli

To use the Windows / RDP scripts as-is you need to be running in a bash environment that can execute mstsc.exe - so Ubuntu on WSL or cygwin.
Otherwise, just connect using your RDP client of choice to the local port, default 54000
